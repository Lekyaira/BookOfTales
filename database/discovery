An encounter will refer to a numbered encounter, a place of power of an N
matrix encounter. The player looks up the encounter number on the encounter
chart, then rolls a die, adds the location value and +1 or +2 for their
destiny track to get the total encounter value. If the value is above
12, it is set to 12. The player then reads the result from the encounter
chart, which is a noun adjective pair and an encounter matrix.

The player then chooses a reaction from the appropriate matrix, then
looks up the Book of Tales encounter paragraph. The paragraph will have
an introduction part, then may have skill parts. If the player has the
skill, they may select that option, otherwise they read the NO SKILL part.
A skill part may be mandatory, and must be selected if the character has
the skill. If the player has master skills, they may choose to use that
skill to read the paragraph above or below this paragraph. If the player
has no mastry skills, they instead roll a fate die to determine if they
read this paragraph, the one above or the one below.
Paragraphs may contain the text "other" which is read as the encounter
adjective+noun.
Paragraphs may have multiple options that the player may choose from, and
may require further rolls.
Once the paragraph has been read, they are given any rewards for their
choices. Rewards can be destiny or story points, positive or negative,
wealth, positive or negative with a limit, skills, statuses or treasures.
Skills, statuses or treasures may be remove from the player as well.
Treasures may be specific or random.
